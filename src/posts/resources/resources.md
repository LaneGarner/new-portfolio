## Intro

Every so often someone who is just starting the journey of learning to code reaches out for advice. I've come across some incredible resources along my path and wanted a place to point others who are just beginning their own journey.

There are tons of great resources for learning web development. From books to YouTube creators to Udemy courses to training websites... the options can be overwhelming at times. This post is a curated list with some of my favorites!

Note: I am currently putting these resources together AS WE SPEAK. So if this list seems a bit incomplete, well it is! Check back later for updates and I will continue to add to this list as I find the time. Thanks for checking this post out and good luck with your learning.

## Docs

Docs are an invaluable way to learn any technology and learning to navigate them is a bit of a right of passage. You will later use docs to learn about packages, plugins, APIs, and more.

Two of the best docs for the basics are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. I still reference both websites all the time&mdash;even though I usually prefer MDN, the examples on W3 have helped me out more than once and are very beginner-friendly.
